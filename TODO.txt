TODO:
- Try to emulate screen resizes only on object instances and/or
  screen mapping, to reduce conversions (idk if already did it)

ON CODE:
- TODO: NEED REWRITING
  - Entire PrompterElImage rewriting, never worked since JS couldn't
    read an external img file and process its pixels in a simple and
    convenient way.
- TODO: PrompterScreen.mutationCallback
  - Must create new DOM elements, and delete if needed from the lists
